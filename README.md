# Tarantool WIT definitions

This repository contains WIT definition for Tarantool DBMS.

## Architecture Decision Record

Aside from enums, we opted to express every Tarantool type as either
record, resource or type alias. Choice of an expressing entity for each
type might seem arbitrary, but they are all aligned with the following
ideas:

Resource is an entity that lives outside of a WASM component. That means
its whole lifecycle is managed entirely by the embedder. These entities are
explicitly created and destroyed by the embedder on command from a WASM
component. Resource entities, unlike records, can have methods.

We made a decision to use resource semantics only for the iterators. One
might argue that the same semantics should apply to the spaces, indexes and
other types, since they are all handled by Tarantool and not by a WASM
component. That is a valid point, but a key difference between a space and
an iterator in regard to the ownesrhip semantics is that space is
manipulated by a `space_id` and is owned by Tarantool, while an iterator
is owned by an application and is manipulated directly.

Resource semantics also requires every resource to be freed after use,
which makes no sense for spaces or indexes, because we would have to free
a reference. Yet still, it makes perfect sense for iterators.

Final thing for consideration is object notation and methods. That feature
off resources looks very appealing to use for other Tarantool types, but it
has a few downsides to it. Every resource must be stored within a resource
table on the embedder side, and removed from there after free. Some of
our target languages have a notion of destructor and some of them don't.
That, in turn, results in making the user responsible for freeing the
resources from the resource table which is inconvenient, makes no sense in
comparison to Lua and leads to memory leaks.

With that in mind, the decision is to sacrifice methods in favor of
preserving the logic and memory safety.

Finally, we have type aliases. These are chosen for types that are
represented on the WASM side as opaque references. Unlike in records,
there is no generally useful underlying primitive to extract (like
`index_id`, for example), so we just wrap this reference into a nicely
named type.

## Adding Tarantool WIT Interfaces

### Dependencies

Make sure you have [wkg](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasm-pkg-tools) installed:

```bash
cargo install wkg
```

### 1. Manual (local) usage

1. **Clone the `tarantool-wit` repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mandesero/tarantool-wit.git
   ```

   You should now have a directory named `tarantool-wit/` containing a `wit/` subfolder
   with all the Tarantool WIT files.

2. **Create or edit `wkg.toml` in your own project to point at that local `wit/` folder:**

   ```toml
   [overrides]
   "tarantool:tarantool" = { path = "<path-to>/tarantool-wit/wit" }
   ```

   Replace `<path-to>/tarantool-wit/wit` with the relative (or absolute) path
   where you cloned `tarantool-wit/wit`.

3. **Fetch the interface into your project:**

   ```bash
   wkg wit fetch
   ```

   After this command completes, youâ€™ll see `wit/deps/tarantool/tarantool@<version>.wasm`
   (and any other dependencies) checked out under `wit/deps/`.


### 2. Fetching the published interface from GHCR

1. **Edit your global (or per-project) `wkg` config** so that all `tarantool:tarantool`
requests resolve to GHCR. Run:

   ```bash
   wkg config --edit
   ```

   This will open your `$WKG_CONFIG_FILE` (usually `~/.config/wasm-pkg/config.toml`) in your
   default editor. Add the following section (or merge it with existing settings):

   ```toml
   [package_registry_overrides]
   "tarantool:tarantool" = { registry = "ghcr.io", metadata = { preferredProtocol = "oci", oci = { registry = "ghcr.io", namespacePrefix = "mandesero/" } } }
   ```

2. **Run `wkg wit fetch` in your project:**

   ```bash
   wkg wit fetch
   ```

   Now any `include tarantool:tarantool@<version>` in your `wit/world.wit` will be pulled from
   `ghcr.io/mandesero/tarantool/tarantool:<version>`, and placed under `wit/deps/` automatically.

### Example `wit/world.wit`

In your `wit/world.wit`, just reference the Tarantool sequence or other types as usual. For example:

```wit
package docs:adder@0.1.0;

world my-world {
  include tarantool:tarantool/types@0.1.0;
  // other includes/exports
}
```

With either the **manual override** (step 1) or the **registry override** (step 2), `wkg wit fetch` will
pull in exactly that `tarantool:tarantool@0.1.0` interface.
